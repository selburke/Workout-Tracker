# Workout-Tracker

* For this project, I created a workout tracker which allows the user to create new workouts, add a recent workout, view their last workout, and view their stats for the last 7 workouts.

* This project utilizes JavaScript, Express.JS routes, MongoDB, and is deployed on Heroku.

# User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

# Deployed Link

* The deployed application can be viewed here: https://sb-workout-tracker.herokuapp.com/
